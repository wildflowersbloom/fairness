Based on Data sheets for datasets by Timnit Gebru, et al. 2018, we are documenting the german credit dataset available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29) 

1. For what purpose was the data set created?
Classify as good or bad credit risk, false positives being worse, losing the bank money.
2. Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?
The data was uploaded by Prof. Dr. Hans Hofmann in 1994, Institut fur Statistik und Okonomie, Universitat Hamburg,
from the years 1973 to 1975 for a large regional bank in southern Germany. The original generator of the data is unknown beyond this.
3. Who funded the creation of the dataset?
The bank?
4. Any other comments?
The information above was mainly taken from the following source: http://www1.beuth-hochschule.de/FB_II/reports/Report-2019-004.pdf which provides a story for the data tracing it back to academic work from as early as 1981.
Bad credits are heavily oversampled (prevalence 5%)
All debtors must have passed some checks of creditworthiness before being granted the credit.
5. What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?
People
6. How many instances are there in total?
1000 total, 300 bad ones and 700 good ones
7. Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample
(not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
Must be a sample
8. What data does each instance consist of? Demographic and bank history attributes
9. Is there a label or target associated with each instance?
10. Is any information missing from individual instances?
11. Are relationships between individual instances made explicit?
12. Are there recommended data splits? No
13. Are there any errors, sources of
noise, or redundancies in the dataset?
14. Is the dataset self-contained,
or does it link to or otherwise rely
on external resources?  Self-contained
15. Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential?
16. Does the dataset contain data
that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or
might otherwise cause anxiety? No
17. Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (for example, by age, gender)? Single women, completely absent. 
18. Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural
persons), either directly or indirectly
(that is, in combination with other
data) from the dataset?
19. Does the dataset contain data
that might be considered sensitive
in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual
orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships,
or locations; financial or health data;
biometric or genetic data; forms of
government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)?
20. Any other comments?
21. How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
the data directly observable? Reported by subjects? 
22. What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data? Application forms?
23. If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling
strategy? Seems arbitrary
24. Who was involved in the data collection process? Not known
25. Over what timeframe was the data collected? 2 years
26. Were any ethical review processes conducted? No
27. Did you collect the data from
the individuals in question directly,
or obtain it via third parties or other
sources (for example, websites)? Indirectly 
28. Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? Most likely not explicity 
29. Did the individuals in question
consent to the collection and use of
their data? Most likely not explicitly
30. If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided
with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses?
