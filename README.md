1. For what purpose was the data set created?
Classify as good or bad credit risk, false positives being worse, losing the bank money.
2. Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?
The data was uploaded by Prof. Dr. Hans Hofmann, Institut fur Statistik und Okonomie, Universitat Hamburg
from the years 1973 to 1975 for a large regional bank in southern Germany. The original generator of the data is unknown beyond this.

4. Any other comments?
The information above was mainly taken from the following source: http://www1.beuth-hochschule.de/FB_II/reports/Report-2019-004.pdf which provides a story for the data tracing it back to academic work from as early as 1981.
Bad credits are heavily oversampled (prevalence 5%)
All debtors must have passed some checks of creditworthiness before being granted the credit.
5. What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?
People
6. How many instances are there in total?
1000 total, 300 bad ones and 700 good ones
7. Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample
(not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
Must be a sample
8. What data does each instance consist of? 
9. Is there a label or target associated with each instance?
10. Is any information missing
from individual instances?
11. Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for
example, users’ movie ratings, social
network links)?
12. Are there recommended data
splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)?
13. Are there any errors, sources of
noise, or redundancies in the dataset?
14. Is the dataset self-contained,
or does it link to or otherwise rely
on external resources (for example,
websites, tweets, other datasets)? 
15. Does the dataset contain data
that might be considered confidential
(for example, data that is protected by
legal privilege or by doctor–patient
confidentiality, data that includes the
content of individuals’ non-public
communications)?
16. Does the dataset contain data
that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or
might otherwise cause anxiety?No
17. Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (for example, by age, gender)?

that might be considered sensitive
in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual
orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships,
or locations; financial or health data;
biometric or genetic data; forms of
government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)?
